- MLP
- SVM
- SGD
- MLP
- Logistic Regression

Each model was tested and training using different combinations of datasets which are explained in the [Research Report]().

#### Files
The `codenet` file contains the metrics obtained in each model that uses CodeNet as input. The files `poj5` and `poj104`contain the metrics obtained from each model which uses POJ with 104 classes and POJ with 5 classes as input, respectively.
