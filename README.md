## :scroll: **Introduction**

Let _D_ be a deep learning model that classifies programs according to the problem they solve. This project aims to evaluate how _D_ behaves with obfuscated code. We want to know how much the accuracy of _D_ is affected.

## :checkered_flag: **Getting Started**
In this section are the steps to reproduce our experiments.


<a id="prerequisites"></a>

### **Prerequsites**
You need to install the following packages to run this project:

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) to run our experiments
* [Python-3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to plot the results in the project's Jupyter Notebook


<a id="setup"></a>

###  **Setup**
First, you need to prepare the environment to run our experiments. Run the following command line:

```bash
$ ./setup.sh
```

> This will download the datasets, build the docker image and create the necessary folders for the project. 

After that, you can set the environment variables into the file `.env` at the project's root. You can change the following variables:

* `MODEL`: This is the machine learning model used in the training/testing phase. You can choose:
    * _"lstm"_ (Long Short-Term Memory) 
    * _"cnn"_ (Convolutional Neural Network by [Lili Mou et al.](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3015812.3016002))
    * _"rf"_ (Random Forest)
    * _"svm"_ (Support Vector Machine)
    * _"knn"_ (K-Nearest Neighbors)
    * _"lr"_ (Logistic Regression)
    * _"mlp"_ (Multilayer Perceptron)
* `TRAINDATASET` or `TESTDATASET`: This is the dataset that will be used in the training phase. You can choose:
    * _"OJClone"_ (POJ-104 dataset used by [Lili Mou et al.](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3015812.3016002))
    * _"BCF"_ (The OJClone dataset that was obfuscated by the [Bogus Control Flow](https://github.com/obfuscator-llvm/obfuscator/wiki/Bogus-Control-Flow) strategy)
    * _"FLA"_ (The OJClone dataset that was obfuscated by the [Control Flow Flattening](https://github.com/obfuscator-llvm/obfuscator/wiki/Control-Flow-Flattening) strategy)
    * _"SUB"_ (The OJClone dataset was obfuscated by the [Instructions Substitution](https://github.com/obfuscator-llvm/obfuscator/wiki/Instructions-Substitution) strategy)
    * _"OLLVM"_ (The OJClone dataset that was obfuscated by the [Control Flow Flattening](https://github.com/obfuscator-llvm/obfuscator/wiki/Control-Flow-Flattening), [Bogus Control Flow Strategy](https://github.com/obfuscator-llvm/obfuscator/wiki/Bogus-Control-Flow) and [Instructions Substitution](https://github.com/obfuscator-llvm/obfuscator/wiki/Instructions-Substitution) strategies, respectively)
    * _"MCMC"_ (The OJClone dataset that was obfuscated by the [Markov Chain Monte Carlo](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.10793.pdf) strategy)
    * _"GA"_ (The OJClone dataset that was obfuscated by the [Genetic Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.10793.pdf) strategy)
    * _"DRLSG"_ (The OJClone dataset that was obfuscated by the [Deep Reinforcement Learning Sequence Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.10793.pdf) strategy)
    * _"RS"_ (The OJClone dataset that was obfuscated by the [Random-Search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.10793.pdf) strategy)
* `OPTLEVELTRAIN` or `OPTLEVELTEST`: The optimization level applied in the traning dataset. You can choose:
    * O0
    * O3
* `NUMCLASSES`: The number of classes of the dataset

### **Running**
Now, you can run the following command line:

```bash
$ ./run.sh
```

> This will run the docker container with the configurations in the `.env` file.

## :bar_chart: **Statistcs**
This folder contains _Jupyter Notebooks_ that plot the data generated by the experiments. Each notebook describes each chart and the steps to develop them.
