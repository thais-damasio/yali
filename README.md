## :scroll: **Introduction**

Let _D_ be a deep learning model that classifies programs according to the problem they solve. This project aims to evaluate how _D_ behaves with obfuscated code. We want to know how much the accuracy of _D_ is affected.

## :checkered_flag: **Getting Started**
In this section are the steps to reproduce our experiments.


<a id="prerequisites"></a>

### **Prerequsites**
You need to install the following packages to run this project:

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) to run our experiments
* [Python-3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to plot the results in the project's Jupyter Notebook


<a id="setup"></a>

###  **Setup**
First, you need to prepare the environment to run our experiments. Run the following command line:

```bash
$ ./setup.sh
```

> This will download the datasets, build the docker image and create the necessary folders for the project. 

After that, you should copy the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`.
You can now set environment variables in the `.env` file at the project's root. You can change the following variables:

<table>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th>Variable</th>
            <th>Description</th>
            <th>Value</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>MODEL</td>
            <td>Selected machine learning model. This variable is required.</td>

### **Running**
Now, you can run the following command line:

```bash
$ ./run.sh
```

> This will run the docker container with the configurations in the `.env` file.
