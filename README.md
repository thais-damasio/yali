## Dataset Folder
Each folder within the **dataset** folder contains data from a specific dataset. These data include:
- Source code in C/C++
- Features extracted using Histogram Pass
- Compiled code using -O0

## Histogram Pass
This an edited version of the Kind's pass that extracts the histogram from the entire program instead of extracting one function at a time.
